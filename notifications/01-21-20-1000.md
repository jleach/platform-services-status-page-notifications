**Aporeto Control Plane Downtime**

On Tuesday Jan 21st between 10:00am and 12:00am PST the Aporeto vendor will be adding a geographically separated automatic failover capability to the Aporeto Control Plane SaaS resulting in about 45 minutes downtime for the Control Plane. The Aporeto enforcers deployed on the BC Govâ€™s Openshift Platform sync with the Control Plane SaaS to get the latest version of the network security policies for the Platform applications. During the Control Plane downtime the existing network security policies (NSPs) will still be in effect provided that the pods and the namespaces that the policies apply to have not been restarted but the new NSPs will not be applied until after the downtime is over. 

Therefore, **we recommend to refrain from running any build or deployment processes  in any of the namespaces/environments on the Platform as well as modify the network security policies directly during the specified time if possible**.

Please post any questions or concerns in **#devops-security** channel.
