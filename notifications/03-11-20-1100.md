
**Repomountie Update**

Today (March 11th) at approximately 11:00AM I will update our friendly Repomountie bot. This update will:

- Allow it to collect information on compliance reporting;
- When it creates a PR assign it to the repo admins.

This update is expected to be transparent with no noticeable service disruption. If you notice anything out-of-the-ordinary DM me (@jason.leach) in RocketChat and I'll disable to bot temporarily.
