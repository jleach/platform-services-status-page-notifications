This coming Sunday morning (March 8th 2020) starting at 6:00am PDT we will be performing a rolling reboot of each of the master nodes in turn, and if required, followed up with a rolling reboot of each of the infra nodes in turn as well.

This change is meant to address some recently-discovered stability concerns after the recent Aporeto upgrade incident, with the net result is to ensure that all key nodes have all of their system pods in a clean and consistent state so that we can work towards resolving stability issues previously noticed (like Kibana accessibility, and oc commands not always working).

We will post here (#devops-alerts) when this work is complete.
